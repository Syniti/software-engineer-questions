1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

Ans:- Harbinger Systems was my first company and there I got my first project for a client known as Vector India. The work was to migrate courses which were on legacy, Articulate and Flash technologies, to the new responsive framework. We were using some scripts(writtem my our seniors) for automation of the task and doing other processes manually. For one course it took around two days to migrate. 
Those scripts were not so efficient, and I thought we could do better. I talked to my manager about it, and explained it to him that we could automate the process better, by updating those scripts and automating other process which were done manually. 
He told me that we have a time constaint, and if I'll work on automation, who will do the task assigned to me. And if it didn't work as expected, we'll lose time and will not be able to meet deadlines. In short, he had trust issues.
So I started working on the automation after completing the assigned task.
After seeing the results, he asked me to work on Automation dedicatedly.

After some time, micro teams were created, and I was leading the team of four, which was working on automation.
With our efforts we brought down the time of migrating of courses from 2 working days to 4 hours.

While looking back at it, I am very proud it because I could see the effect it had on my project in terms of time and efficiency it had. Time assigned for our project was 6 months, and we completed it in just four months. Our clients were very happy with our work, and we bagged another project from the same client.


2. What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working on.

Ans:- Currently I am not working on any side project. I have taken up a course from Udemy on microservices and Spring cloud as we are using them in our projects and I wanted to learn more about the same.

3. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it.

Ans:- Recently read an article about circuit breakers and tracing using slueth, in microservices. I really liked it because how we can use this to make our application resilient, they are used to prevent cascade errors, and trace the incoming request.

4. Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one specific aspect that makes it truly great.

Ans:- Amazon. One aspect that makes it truly great, is the ease of use and customer support.
